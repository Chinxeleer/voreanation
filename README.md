# Voreanation

## Problem description

Its a donations app dedicated to solve the problem of catered residence students throwing away food they get from the DH which intern expires before being eaten.

We discovered that there are students on campus and off campus who usually due to bursary or supplier complications can struggle to find food for themselves while catered students throw away the food that they maybe don't find time to eat.

> Why not give away the food then ?

## The platform

Voreanation which translated to giving-nation. This app breaches the gap between students in need and students with ample items to give. The donor donates the food(posts the items they are giving away on the platform) and the donee posts the things they are in need of. An algorithm in the map connects the two people. The donor shares where and when they can meet the donee (_for security this has to be within the campus at specific locations, which are provided by the app_).
